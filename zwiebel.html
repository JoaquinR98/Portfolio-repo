          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Inspired by my own journey when learning german, I stumbled upon a
            maze of material at the beginning. With the huge amount of topics,
            resources, apps and other material it can definitely be overwhelming
            for any learner, especially beginners.

        <h2 class="section-item">Competitive analysis</h2>
        <p>
          The process was started by looking at the direct and indirect
          competitors that are available at the moment. By looking at the
          competition, I would get the gist of what challenges and
          aooportunities are to be expected. I tried to compare the overall user
          experience and the features provided.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Given that Zwiebel is intended to be a recollection of resources and
          features, my initial idea was to gather the most valuable strengths of
          other competitor apps and have them all in one place.

        <p>
          In order to gather both quantitative and qualitative data on potential
          users, I created and conducted a survey on Google forms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I gathered 38 responses from language learners online</p>

        <p><b>Key Findings</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Almost <b>half</b> of respondants (47.4%) have quit learning a
            language in the past
          </li>
          <li>
            The most popular methods of learning are apps, movies/TV Shows and
            to a lesser extent Social media and News sites
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>55%</b> of respondants find the vast amount of resources online
            to be overwhelming

          <li>
            A whopping <b>71,1%</b> believe their learning routine could be more

        <p>
          To better understand pain points and goals of language learners, I
          came up with an interview script and conducteed user interviews among
          3 voluntary participants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Key Findings</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Useful and accurate recommendations </b> are helpful to filter
            through the overwhelming available material

          <li>
            People like <b>challenge</b> and
            <b>keeping track of their own progress </b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Learners greatly value <b> immersion </b> in a language as they feel
            it's one of the best approaches to language learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Their learning routine includes multiple apps, sites and sources
            online
          </li>
          <li>
            Some expressed <b> frustration about the lack of variety </b> in

          <li>"Anki" is a tool that all participants seem to use and like</li>
          <li>
            Having a structured and scheduled learning routine is important to
            them as otherwise they tend to neglect it without one

          The real meaning of Zwiebel is "onion" in german so I wanted it's logo
          to resemble an onion and give it a minimalistic style with vibrant
          colors. At the same time, it resembles a target board, which depicts
          the accuracy and precision of learning a language.
