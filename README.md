### Hi and welcome to my profile!


I'm an ambitious learner of Web development and UX design. I've set up my goal of learning something new every day.

Currenty learning:
* In-depth JavaScript
* JS Frameworks
  * Vue.js
* CSS Frameworks 
  * Tailwind
  * Sass
* Git

I am far from being an expert in any subject of web development so I would be happy to receive any help or to collaborate with someone.
