            One day as I was dwelling online, I stumbled upon a real need of
            someone in need of a tool that would help them with the cleaning
            management of the household with her new roommate.
            <br />
            Given the lack of non-individual scheduling application, she was in

          I began this design cycle by reviewing real user interviews of two

          As the first step of the define stage and converging phase. I
          synthesized the collected data from my research into a brainstormed
          and sorted affinity diagram that would aid me in creating a first
          foundation for the ideation process and visualizing my findings and
          ideas that would come up.

        <p>
          Clustering the user data and with the use of the affinity diagram, I
          conceptualized a persona named Nina that would help me in empathizing
          with my target users as accurately as possible and designing a better
          product for them.

          I felt the need to further empathize with my end users, so using
          collected qualitative data, I made an empathy map revolving around my
          persona Nina. This helped me visualize her attitudes and process when
          scheduling a cleaning day in a busy student lifestyle.

          I organized and fleshed out my ideas and information in a visual
