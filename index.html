          <p>
            Since catholics today donâ€™t have a confortable and efficient way of
            reaching out to priests, other than going from church to church,
            MyPriest was made to provide a new and modern manner to do this.

        <p>
          To gather both quantitative and qualitative data on potential users, I
          created and conducted a survey on Google forms.
        </p>
        <p>I collected 141 responses from catholics online.</p>

        <p><b>The key findings of the survey were:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>78.4%</b> of participants who confess on a regular basis do not
            go to the same priest for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>30.4% </b>of participants had or have difficulty in finding a
            priest to confess to.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>71.4%</b> of participants would like an easier channel to contact
            a priest, with only 19.3% undecided.

        <h2 class="section-item">User interviews</h2>
        <p>
          In order to delve into some of the results the surveys gave me and
          gain some insights about them, I recruited 3 participants for user
          interviews. Here, I focused on asking open.ended questions about their
          experiences to learn as much as possible about the users and validate
          my understanding of them.

        <blockquote>
          <i
            >"I couldn't help but feel like a burden to my general confessor
            (who also presided over my wedding) so I stopped contacting him,
            especially in this pandemic. He was a bit high-profile and I could
            tell he had social engagements / other people to look after. In a
            country like the Philippines I do think the ratio of people to
            priests is through the roof" <br />
            <br />

            "...Granted I do look forward to moving to Australia where the
            community is smaller and I hope the confession and talking to a
            priest in general doesn't feel transactional"

        <p>
          Based on the feedback and insights gained from the research phase, I
          created two personas who had the profile of someone who would use the
          MyPriest application. These personas demonstrate the key user goals
          and frustrations in my findings.

          To begin visualizing the process that a user will go through to
          accomplish their goal I developed a journey map. I chose Darien as the
          main actor of it.

          I wanted to give a visual respresentation of the app's organization

        <p>
          At the early stage of the design phase, I drew some sketches to

          With my early ideas sketched out, I began creating more detailed
          wireframes on Figma of the layout and key screens the users would be
          interacting with.
